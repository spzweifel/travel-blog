            <h1>What a lot of people in my life don't know is that half of my family is from California. One day in 2020, I decided to take a trip out there to visit that half. It was the first time I had seen them in probably about 10 or more years. I flew into Sacramento where my aunt Vickie picked me up and showed me a bit around the town. After spending a night in Sacramento, we met with my aunt Mary and my cousin Stacie and drove down the Pacific highway to San Luis Obispo where my late father grew up. Unfortunately, when I visited was also during the massive wildfires created by the infamous gender reveal fire.</h1>

            <h1> Due to this, all of the views of natural beauty were obscured by the smoke and smog. Regardless, I was able to see such amazing wildlife. Before this trip, I had only seen otters, sealions, and cormorants in zoos or on tiktok and instagram. It was so cool to see these wild animals in their natural habitats but not only that, they were even just hanging out meters away from people! They were actually sleeping on man made objects in Avila Bay! {/*insert images of the otters, sealions, or cormorants here*/} California is such a beautiful place. We went all over the bay area but not quite into San Francisco. We never saw the Golden Gate Bridge for example. What we did see was this place called Morro Bay Rock. I had never heard of it before but apparently it is very well known. We pulled up to the parking lot and started walking down the path. I noticed several signs near the giant rock saying no climbing allowed. It made me think that maybe a lot of rock climbers saw this massive rock in the bay and thought to themselves, "I need to climb that," and it probably didn't go so well for them. Off to the side of the rock was this huge field covered in stacked rocks. I had never seen anything like it! Rock stacking has always impressed me. I've never understood why people do this or how they learned. It seems so time consuming and frustrating. Regardless, it made me want to climb it even more. I didn't but I thought about it. I was able to get a few good pictures and hopefully this blog will inspire others to travel as well</h1>
