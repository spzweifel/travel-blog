            <h1>What a lot of people in my life don't know is that half of my family is from California. One day, I decided to take a trip out there to visit them. It was the first time I had seen them in probably about 10 or more years. I flew into Sacramento where my aunt Vickie picked me up and showed me a bit around the town. After spending a night in Sacramento, we met with my aunt Mary and my cousin Stacie and drove down the Pacific highway to San Luis Obispo where my late father grew up. Unfortunately, when I visited was also during the massive wildfires created by a gender reveal fire. Due to this, all of the views of natural beauty were obscured by the smoke and smog. Regardless, I was able to see such amazing wildlife. Before this trip, I had only heard of otters, sealions, and cormorants in their natural habitats. Afterwards, it was so cool to see these wild animals, not even just hanging out meters away from people, but actually sleeping on man made objects in Avile Bay! I was able to get a few good pictures and hopefully this blog will inspire others to travel as well</h1>
